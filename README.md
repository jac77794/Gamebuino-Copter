# Copter by Anny

A simple clone of the famous [Helicopter Game](http://www.helicoptergame.net) for Gamebuino.

Rubbish photo, because I work on Mac/Linux and can't take an emulator screenshot:

How to play:

- Press A at the title screen to start the game
- In-game, press and hold A or B to rise and release to fall
- Try not to crash, get a good score!
- After you do inevitably crash (which you can take as an allegory if so inclined), press C to return to the title screen. You can start again from here

Pre-built binaries are available in the `bin` directory to download and run on your own Gamebuino.
